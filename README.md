# Principles of Programming Languages 2015

This repository contains all source files wrote during exercise lectures.

1. The first lecture covers the basics of Scheme (lambdas, how to define functions and variables, bindings, lists and vectors), tail recursion, basic constructs (if, cond, for-each and begin), mutability, evaluation strategy and structs.
2. The second lecture covers how to define functions with a indefinite number of parameters, higher order functions and macros.
